        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>My name is Cat Brosius. I graduated with an AA in fashion design from the Fashion Institute of Design &
            Merchandising in Los Angeles in 2010.
            I worked as a designer and CAD
            artist in New York for about 6 years. A CAD artist is a computer-aided design artist, so my job was similar
            to that of a graphic designer. I drew garment sketches and created presentations in Adobe Illustrator,
            created
            graphics for t-shirts etc., and assisted the textile print designer. I interned for about 8 months and then
            was hired by an intimate apparel and swimwear company. About 2 years later, I found a new job at a juniors
            apparel company. In January 2017 I moved to my parents' home in Seattle so I could earn my bachelor's
            degree, change careers and save money to purchase a home. I am considering becoming a graphic and/or web
            designer.

        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>
            Photography is one of my hobbies and I love to travel. Photographers for National Geographic are a source
            of
            inspiration for me. I gravitate towards photographs focusing on landscapes and nature, and I am drawn to
            contrast in
            texture, light and color. Black and white film photography is my favorite medium. In high school I spent a
            lot
            of time in my film photography classes and in the darkroom. That is one place where I could easily get
            caught in a
            time warp. While digital photography is certainly a more convenient means of expression in terms of storing
            and
            editing photos, my heart remains with black and white film.

        <h3>My Camera</h3>
        <p>I recently purchased an <a href="https://www.getolympus.com/us/en/e-m10-mark-ii.html">Olympus OM-D EM-10
                Mark II</a>.
            It is a mirrorless digital camera. I
            bought it with a 42mm lens but other lenses are available for purchase. The main 3 reasons I
            chose this camera are that it is lightweight, it is water resistant (necessary for Seattle), and
            I saw many positive reviews for it online. I also liked its retro appearance.
            <br />
            <b>Tip</b>: when looking
            to buy a new digital camera, wait until the new model comes out and get last year's model if possible.
            The new models often have only miniscule changes and you can usually get the previous year's model
            at a significant discount. That's what I did!
            <br /><b>Note</b>: Unfortunately I took most of my photos posted on my theme site with an iPhone 6S.
            After spending so much money living in New York and traveling, at the time I did not have the funds
            necessary to purchase a camera and figured I could make do with my phone. As a result, my photos on this
            site are fine for screen viewing but are unfortunately not the best quality for printing.
